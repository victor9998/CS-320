1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure? <br>
    - I can ensure that my program is functional and secure by running tests throughout the coding process. It is also important to begin incorporating secure practices early on in the software development lifecycle. There are also multiple tools out there that can aid in securing the code. For example, a couple great cools I have found and used are Snyk and the maven dependency tool. JUnit tests are also beneficial to make sure the code is correct, and the requirements are being met. <br>
2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program? <br>
    - The best way to ensure that the customersâ€™ needs are met is by first making sure that the requirements are understood by both parties. If there are any questions on the requirements, they should be asked and answered as soon as possible to prevent future delays and losses. I then make a plan that I can follow throughout the whole project and try to stick to it. This allows each stage in the software development lifecycle to flow easily. <br>
3. How do I approach designing software? <br>
    - I begin approaching software by first reading and understanding the requirements. Then once I begin writing the code, I make sure to compile it every few lines to make sure that everything is running correctly. It is also important to follow standard coding practices so that the code can be easily read and edited by others. <br>
